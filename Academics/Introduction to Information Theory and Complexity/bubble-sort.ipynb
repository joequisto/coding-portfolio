        "**Task**: Your main task is to create a bubble sort function that takes in some list as input and prints each row iteration until we reach the final sorted list. You need to sort the input list in **ascending** order. The following specs must be met:\n",
        "\n",
        "* The sorting must be in **ascending** order.\n",
        "* It only takes in an input list (we prepared this for you already).\n",
        "* **Use function recursions**. Go research what this means. If you can't do recursions (because you opt to use for loops only) that's fine but your final max score would be 8 pts. out of 10 pts.\n",
        "* **Don't forget to put in your student number for the function that generates a random list**. We'll use your student number as a seed for the random number generator.\n",
        "* **Print each pass in your program**. Each pass is one row sweep.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Grading Rubrics**\n",
        "\n",
        "* If your program works AND you used function recursions, you get 10 full points. You can use at most 1 for loop for this case.\n",
        "* If your program works BUT you did not use function recursions, you only get 8 points. This is when you use 2 or more for loops. For loops have high complexity, that's why we try to use recursions instead.\n",
        "* No submission or the code doesn't work is automatically 0 points.\n"
